Hanura  Takeaway ( Haway) is an SME engaged in the delivery of goods  and food. To facilitate transactions for goods and food delivery  services, it is necessary to develop applications that simplify the  transaction process. In developing web services, it is necessary  to   excha nge   data   that   is   accessed   via   standard   internet  protocols. Therefore, we need a web service in developing this  application. Implementing a RESTful API web service will  certainly facilitate the development of software applications  outside the system or with   different programming languages   or  platforms. This research will develop web service architecture  using RESTful API in Takeaway application. To optimize the  URI, several parameters are used, including filtering, sorting,  selection and pagination. The Ta keaway application consists of  a website as a backend and an Android - based as a frontend.  From the test results based on the function method using the  Postman application, it shows that the REST API Sever built on  the server has been running well. In testi ng the response time  using the Apache JMeter application, the application shows a  good response time. Meanwhile, the comparison of responses  and requests to SOAP and REST architectures shows that  REST takes faster time.  Keywords — application   development,   RE STful   API,   web  services  I.   I NTRODUCTION  Currently , Indonesia and even the world are being shocked  by an infectious virus originating from the province of Wuhan,  China.   This virus is considered very dangerous because the  transmission is so fast. Then, WHO dete rmined and named the  virus as Coronavirus Disease of 2019 or abbreviated as Covid -  19   [1] .   The Covid - 19 virus has caused millions of deaths  worldwide. So that it becomes a frightening specter for ev ery  human being to interact at close range. Indonesia has taken  steps to deal with the Covid - 19 pandemic, one of which is by  issuing health protocols, including:   wash hands, wear masks,  keep distance, stay away from crowds and reduce mobility .  The Covid - 1 9 pandemic that has occurred has had an  unfavourable impact on the economy, especially in the trade  sector   [2] .   One of the trade sectors affected by the Covid - 19  pandemic is Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The  Covid - 19 pandemic affects the income of SMEs, this is due to  the difficulty of running a business, especially in marketing  and selling products that   are carried out with an offline system  [3] .   The decline in sales during this pandemic period was felt  by   SMEs   in   Hanura   Village   in   Teluk   Pandan   District,  Pesawaran Regency, Lampung Province. For businesses in the  culinary field, it is advisable to provide delivery or take away  services   in   order   to   r educe   crowds.   This   opens   up  opportunities for delivery or delivery services. However, in  Hanura Village there are no online motorcycle taxis or start -  up sector delivery of goods that reach the area. This is due to  the distance between Hanura Village and th e city centre.  The development of technology today is balanced with the  emergence of applications that help in human work. The use  of applications in helping human work is considered to be able  to increase the speed and efficiency of energy, time and cost s  without reducing the quality of the work done   [4] [5] .   The  delivery system has been implemented by several start - ups  including Gojek,   Grab, Maxim,   Shopee and others. The  delivery application is an application that can help custome rs  to order products and have them delivered to their destination  without having to go to the location and meet the seller   [6] .  The use of online delivery applications is considered effective  in helping buyers and sellers because it facilitates transactions  and can be done by buyers wherever and whenever   [7] .  Businesses run using applications   can increase marketing  reach to get new customers   [8] .   Web applications are currently  widely   used   in   building   information   systems.   Website  development th at is used for backend or web view on other  platforms, for example Android, has faced many obstacles,  including interoperability and integrating different systems.  So it takes the implementation of a web architecture that can  overcome this.  Currently, many   web services have been developed using  the   REST   (Representational   State   Transfer)   architecture.  Where the architecture uses the existing functionality of the  application   layer   protocol   Hypertext   Transfer   Protocol  (HTTP)   [9] .   The existence of RE ST has resulted in an increase  in the use of websites that use this architecture when compared  to the use of traditional web services with Simple Object  Access   Protocol   (SOAP).   Large   companies,   including  Twitter, Amazon, etc., have used REST - like interface s for  their services with Application Programming Interfaces (API)  documentation.   REST   implementation   facilitates   the  development of software applications outside the system,  because it offers the use of different programming languages  or platforms   [10] .  978-1-6654-0546-1/21/$31.00 ©2021 IEEE  2021 1st International Conference on Electronic and Electrical Engineering and Intelligent System (ICE3IS)  132  2021 1st International Conference on Electronic and Electrical Engineering and Intelligent System (ICE3IS) | 978-1-6654-0546-1/21/$31.00 ©2021 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/ICE3IS54102.2021.9649679  Authorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSITAS GADJAH MADA.

            REST which is an architecture   for the application of web  services in applying the concept of switching between states  [11] .   The st ate here can be described as a browser requesting  a web page, on the server side it will send the current state of  the web page to the browser.   The REST API allows various  systems to communicate and send/receive data in a very  simple way   [12] .   Inside the RESTful API there is a REST  client that can access data/resources on the REST server where  each resource will be distinguished by a global ID o r URIs  (Universal Resource Identifiers). This makes the RESTful  API very suitable to be applied to startup websites that are  integrated with smartphones, one of wh ich is the Takeaway  application .   Despite this trend, there are still no standards  regarding R ESTful web service development, especially on  URI resource optimization URIs.  This research will develop web services architecture using  RESTful   API   in   Takeaway   application.   The   Takeaway  application consists of a website as a backend and an Android -  based a s a frontend. The RESTful API implementation is used  to provide convenience in combining functions to develop  application programs without relying on the same operating  system, programming language, or database because this web  service communicates using u niversal standard data formats,  namely XML   and   JSON.   For   development   standards   in  optimizing URI resources, this paper will use parameters  including filtering, sorting, selection and pagination.  II.   R ELATED   W ORK  Currently, the development of web services using   REST  services has been widely used, and even provides available  web Application Programming Interfaces (API)   [10] . Several  studies show that developers have switched from Simple  Object Access Protocol (SOAP) to Representational State  Transfer (REST)   web services, as a means of websit e or  application services   [10] [13] . REST is considered to provid e  e asy access to data resources   [11] . The REST architecture was  introduced in 2000, by Thomas Fieldin g, and is based on the  principles that   underpin the World Wide Web   [14] . Sever al  studies have used the RESTfu l API in the web service  architecture   on   the   developed   web   [15] [16] [17] [18] .   In  research   [19] , RE…"
